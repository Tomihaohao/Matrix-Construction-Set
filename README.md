# The Matrix Construction Set
>This tool will allow developer to do pixel perfect CSS3 Transforms by dragging and dropping objects on the screen.

Straight from Zoltan Dulac's [article about CSS matrices](http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2011/01/07/css3-matrix-transform-for-the-mathematically-challenged/)

## Project goals

In no particular order, some are small, some are big:

* Solve issues in Chrome
* Make it easier to edit the transformed object (rotate, scale, â€¦)
* Remember the last used settings
* Make it more exact (sometimes the corners jump to a different place when dropped)
* Clean up UI
* Remove "submit changes" button (make it *live*)
* Update the matrix while the corners are being dragged
* Use 3D matrices to move the fourth corner
